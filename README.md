### **Introduction**
We love Cryptocurrencies, we love treasure hunting, why not make a tool for the adventurous

<b><i>HashHound doesn't process refunds.</i></b>

### **How does it work?**
HashHound utilizes multiple bruteforcing modules and attack vectors to crack existing Bitcoin wallets. From Hex private key bruteforcing to Seed Phrase bruteforcing, we got you covered.

<b><i>HashHound comes in 3 versions:</i></b>

- <b>Version 4 (Zeus)</b>: Switched from Bootstrap to Tailwind for a better User Interface. User now only needs username and license key. Better performance with improved seed bruteforce.

- <b>Version 3 (Athena) - deprecated</b>: Better security for HashHound customers, authentication with a license key, username and password. HashHound code base is now obfuscated. Seed wallet bruteforcing is introduced only to VIP users.

- <b>Version 2 (Hera) - deprecated</b>: Significant improvement from the prior version of HashHound, better UI and stability. Better threading management.

- <b>Version 1 (Nyx) - deprecated</b>: A basic version of HashHound. Although simple but it gets the job done. Only has 1 hex bruteforce module.

### **How long does it take until I can find a funded Bitcoin wallet?**
HashHound and its developers does not guarantee success while using this tool. While this is based purely on luck, why not giving it a shot?
